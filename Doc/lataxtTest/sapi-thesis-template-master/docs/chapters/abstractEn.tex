In today's world microcontroller system can be found in a lot of things and
they have a big processing capacity and can be used generally in a lot of
different applications. They have a lot of functions, from making a LED
blink to automating complex systems. They also can be easily connected to
external components so this way they can be used in more ways.

For this cause this dissertation main goal it making a system which will be
able to identify simple electoronic components whith their aproximative
values and their pinouts.
In electoronics there are a lot of electronic components, like resistors,
capacitors, diodes and transistors. But when building a circuit
it is good to know what is the component and their pinout, which is more important
on semiconductors. In a lot of times the identifier values are unreadable
or there is no datasheet avabile so it is hard to idnetify the component.
For this purpose the "electronic component teszter" was made which automaticall
identif and outputs the component values or outputs if if failed to identify
the component. The process if fully automatic, only the component need to be 
connected to the tester socket and togle switch or it automatically starts
when it is connected to power.

The dissertation will cover microcontroller applications and their design
for component recognition and measurement.
